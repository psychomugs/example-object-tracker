Help on method connect in module socketio.client:

ccoonnnneecctt(url, headers={}, transports=None, namespaces=None, socketio_path='socket.io') method of socketio.client.Client instance
    Connect to a Socket.IO server.
    
    :param url: The URL of the Socket.IO server. It can include custom
                query string parameters if required by the server.
    :param headers: A dictionary with custom headers to send with the
                    connection request.
    :param transports: The list of allowed transports. Valid transports
                       are ``'polling'`` and ``'websocket'``. If not
                       given, the polling transport is connected first,
                       then an upgrade to websocket is attempted.
    :param namespaces: The list of custom namespaces to connect, in
                       addition to the default namespace. If not given,
                       the namespace list is obtained from the registered
                       event handlers.
    :param socketio_path: The endpoint where the Socket.IO server is
                          installed. The default value is appropriate for
                          most cases.
    
    Example usage::
    
        sio = socketio.Client()
        sio.connect('http://localhost:5000')
